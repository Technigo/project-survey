My reflections on how this week's project turned out:

I am happy with the way this project turned out because I learned a lot about building custom form elements
and adding form validations this week. Working with React Hooks is something I really enjoy because I really
enjoy working with React!

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:

I would like to have componenet explained in more details. More specifically when you should create a new 
componenet and how to use them in the right way to keep your code dry.
