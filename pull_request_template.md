My reflections on how this week's project turned out:

I had already managed to build a some what working project when the .map() was covered on the code session.
I got the mapping to work but it rendered one section per option.
So instead of having one section with the question 'In which one of our offices would you like to work?' and all the options underneath, I got 4 sections with height: 100vh under eachother with the question and one option. Didnt' have time to restructure.

I also tried to create a component with the OK button after I was done, which worked, and when I have more time I will restructure the site to have it look good, not only working.

I think the project's OK, but I had to redo some things when I deployed it and tested on my iPhone where a lot of stuff didn't quite work as they did in my desktop browser. After this the layout is not exactly how I wanted it to be.


Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:

I have read about the accessibility again but I'm still not sure what is best practice. If I don't add tabIndex='0' to my h:es and p:s I can't get the screen reader to read them, but I don't find any info about it being necessary to do tabIndex to elements like this.
