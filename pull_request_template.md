My reflections on how this week's project turned out:

I'm satisfied about how the site looks and that I got it to work, but knowing what I know now I would structure it differently if I had the time.

I had already managed to build a some what working project when the .map() was covered on the code session.
I got the mapping to work but it rendered one section per option.
So instead of having one section with the question 'In which one of our offices would you like to work?' and all the options underneath, I got 4 sections with height: 100vh under eachother with the question and one option. Didnt' have time to restructure.

I also tried to create a component with the OK button after I was done, which worked, and when I have more time I will restructure the site to have it look good, not only working.

In the coming projects I will use all this knowledge to try to get it right from the start.


Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:

I have read about the accessibility again but I'm still not sure what is best practice. If I don't add tabIndex='0' to my h:es and p:s I can't get the screen reader to read them, but I don't find any info about it being necessary to do tabIndex to elements like this.
