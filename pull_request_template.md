My reflections on how this week's project turned out:
I had already managed to build a some what working project when the .map() was covered on the code session and since I'm not that good yet I had a hard time changing my code and get the same function and look.
In the coming projects I will use all this knowledge to get it right from the start.

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:
 I tried to map my radio button options AFTER I hade structured my site and I got the mapping to work but it rendered one section per option.
 So instead of having one section with the question 'In which one of our offices would you like to work?' and all the options underneath, I got 4 sections with height: 100vh under eachother with the question and one option. Didnt' have time to figure out how to solve this.
