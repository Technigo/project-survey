        <p>But, when scrolling on Netflix, you are overwhelmed by all the options available. You quickly call your friend and trusted tv-nerd Matilda to get help, but she is busy taking a nap and cannot respond.</p>
        <p>Your bowl of snacks is looking at you, dripping with disappointment.</p>
