      <h1>A survey on what people choose to drink when in a cafe</h1>

      <p>Coffee, tea, or maybe something else? This short survey aims to find
        out just what cafe visitors want to drink, and how often.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would be immensely happy if you would like to answer a few
        questions, the survey only takes about 2 minutes to complete. Thanks! âœ¨
