      For this reason, I've curated a playlist of afrobeats with an amapiano twist for you.
      Amapiano, meaning "the pianos" in Zulu and Xhosa, is a genre of deep house music
      hailing from South Africa, and it's taken the continent and the rest of the
      world by storm since last year. Naturally, the West African music scene has
      embraced amapiano and created its own spin on it,
      resulting in afrobeats tracks with a hypnotic house beat and the distinctive
      "log drum" bass sound (listen for the humming and purring wooden sound in the beat).
