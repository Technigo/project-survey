        You often find yourself listening to music to {reason}, and
      your favourite place to listen to music is {location}. Out of the four genres
      I listed, you enjoy {genre} the most.
      The music you listen to could be described as {feel}.

      For this reason, I've curated a playlist of afrobeats with an R&B twist for you. Perhaps
      the most globally popular style of afrobeats currently, Afro-R&B boasts some of the biggest
      names in music over the entire continent. Artists like WizKid, Burna Boy and Tems dominate
      the Afro-R&B scene and have in the last couple of years had big global breakthroughs,
      helping push afrobeats onto the mainstream Western music scene. If you enjoy R&B,
      I'm sure you'll love the addition of a West African beat and Nigerian/Ghanaian pidgin.
