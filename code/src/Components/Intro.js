          <p>
          Our society is ever-changing and fast-paced. 
          </p>
          
          <p>The museums of our city are however often said to represent the opposite:
          a stable foundation.</p>
          
          <p>But does that make them... boring? If so, we want to know. 
          <span className="bold-p"> So thank you for taking the time to answer this survey, 
          and for helping us to make Stockholm's museums better <span aria-hidden="true">🏛 </span></span>
