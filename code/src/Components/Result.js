        What you like most about your workplace
        are the {adjective} {foodNoun}.
        In fact, the {adjective} {foodNoun} are a big part of who you are.
        If you could pick something to bring with you to a desert island that would
        definitely be {adjective} {foodNoun}.
          <br />
        In your spare time you enjoy {ingVerb} with your {clothingNoun} on,
        preferably in the company of {celebrity}.
        But let&#39;s be real here.
        It&#39;s likely that you will end up {ingVerb} alone, since {celebrity} probably has more
        important stuff to do than {ingVerb} with you.
        That would be really cool though.
          <br />
        If you were to change your career,
        you would probably end up in the {jobSector} industry.
        There is a high demand for particularily {jobSector} jobs,
        so that will probably work out really well for you.
        Fun fact: Rumor has it that {celebrity} used to work in the {jobSector} industry before
        getting famous.
          <br />
        You are most proud of your {happyAdjective} smile, your great {bodyPart} and
        your ability to always {infinitiveVerb}.
        Your previous boss would probably describe you as {descriptiveAdjective}.
