# Project

The project brief was to create a survey, using useState. The form should include different form elements and be divided into components. I selected a theme for my survey and started to do a prototype in Figma.

When I had my prototype I started to build my React project.

If I was able to redo the project I would spend more time on error handling and desructuring of the project. I would for example move the buttons into the question components. I would also add vizualisation to show how many steps it is and on which step the user currently are at right now.
