# Music Releases
The assignment this week was to build a survey form with React. It needed to have at least three questions and one being radio button and one a drop down. When clicking submit it should show a summary of the selected answers.

## The problem
I watched the videos with Jennie that I find very helpful. I started with doing all code in App.js and then split it up to Header.js and Summary.js.. I've used React and the useState function. Since I'm in the middle of moving to a house (next week) I haven't had that much time these week so my site is very basic. But it feels like I've understood the code pretty well and that feels nice. If I had more time I would have styled it better and also split it up to even more components.
