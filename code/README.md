 # Technigo React Starter App
 
The assignment
A survey form built with React using useState-hook.

The problem
Started the project by looking at some old code and really try to understand the different steps. Used a lot of vw/vh in the styling, and didnÂ´t really use it correctly so I had to re-style almost everything, lesson learned!
If I had more time I would have styled the dropdown-menu.
Still have a few bugs with the styled radiobuttons to fix, and some more accessability-focus.
