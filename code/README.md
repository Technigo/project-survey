# Technigo React Starter App

This app has been generated using `create-react-app`, then cleaned up a little so we have a project with just the elements we need to get started.



## Project plan

I made a good plan complete with drawings and illustrations, it gave me directions for how I wanted to outline my project and clarrity on what would be needed.

1. create json file containing all questions and answer alternatived. The objective was that this file was the only one needing updating if the servey where to be updated.
2. Next up, the components: to my understanding I needed Form - two different Input types, a Submit and a Summary.
3. I ended up with Form - RadioInput - SelectInput - Submit - Summary so pretty close to plan
4. my issues started with the .map metod, I first did all the ,mapping in Form but realised that the select input wouldnÂ´t work with the options coming from a component and the select tag in the Form. Solved the issue of not getting any values by moving the .map for that quetsion into the component.
5. had some issues with grouping radio buttons, but found solution toghether with team mates in group.
6. Added simple styles

All and all, I like the lego approach of react but need to keep practicing and understand basic javascript funtions to make the most of the possibilities. Had an awful busy week at work if that counts for anything :)
