# Technigo Survey form with React
In this project the goal was to create a survey tool with React using state and controlled forms.

## The problem
Due to sickness I had trouble with finishing the project this week. That's why I'll hand it in like this and then I'll come back to this and continue working on it. I think the app works as it should - besides my radio button. They can all be checked in, so I need to come back and fix that. Besides that my project needs styling.
