The assignment this week was to build a survey form with React. It needed to have at least three questions and one being radio button and one a drop down. When clicking submit it should show a summary of the selected answers.

## The problem
I started with doing all code in App.js and then split it up to Header.js and Summary.js.. I've used React and the useState function. It feels like I've understood the code pretty well and that feels nice. If I had more time I would have styled it better and also split it up to even more components.
