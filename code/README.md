# Secret Santa survey

This project is an exercise in controlled forms with functional React components for personal use.
The design of this project comes from a Typeform template:
https://www.typeform.com/templates/t/secret-santa-form/

Thanks also to https://www.zondicons.com for providing free and great looking svg icons

If I had more time, I would try to implement the transition animations seen in the Typeform template
