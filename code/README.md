# Survey project

The goal for this project was to learn to use the useState hook in React and how to connect html form inputs to state. 
 
I am a gym owner, and we have "week challenges" at our gym. I decided to make a Week Challenge Registration survey which I could use later for real after improving it so that it saves the results.

If I would have hade more time I would have done a button which allows user to change answers before submmitting. I also would have done a user input validation.
