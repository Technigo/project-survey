# Technigo React Starter App

I created a travel survey with React. 
It lets you add some input as your name, if you prefer winter or sun vaccaion and your favorite transportation. 

Regarding if you choose winter or sun, different classes will be shown in the summary. 

I got stuck on how to show or hide text or just chose what to render, but iÂ´m satisfied with the solution I got in the end.
