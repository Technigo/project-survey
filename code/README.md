# Survey form with React 

The goal this week was to create a Typeform-like survey by using React state.


## The working progress 

I started with reading up on React, and the useState hook that I used to add the states to the function components. Then I just tried to get into the coding, and after some trial and errors, I got a functioning base that I could build on. It was then quite fun to see how I could connect all pieces into one big "machinery", and I really do understand why React is a popular tool. I'm hoping to learn more about it!

If I had more time, I would've worked more on the accessibility part.
