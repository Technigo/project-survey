# Project Survey

This weeks project was to build a survey using REACT.

## The problem
I enjoyed this weeks project a lot! This was the first time I worked with controlled forms as well as useState. It is a bit tricky to know the best way to approach the component structure and I had to redo it a bit in the end. If I would have had more time I would have wanted to work with validation.
