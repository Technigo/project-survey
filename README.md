# Project Survey - Dream Cat 

This project was made during the Technigo Bootcamp.  
The main goal was to practice React and State while creating a survey form. 


## The problem 
I've created a survey with three questions displayed in text input, radio buttons and a drop down meny. Depending on your answers you will see a summary in the end with your answers. 

The project is built with React and i started with a one page survey with all the questions displayed on the front page  and did accesibilty testing on each item. I made sure i had the correct semantics to make sure that the form was accesible with keyboard and screen reader. 

This week i wanted to challenge myself more and decided to make the survey a multi step form. So i decided to create a file called survey, added an array for each item page and last connected them with the summary page similar to the first forms structure.
