# Survey form with React

The brief for this weeks project was to create a survey using React, with a summary of the user's choice. I created a survey of "Daily Notes", like a short diary for daily reflections.

## The problem

If I had more time I would have created a function that shows today's date + changing weather icon depending on the user's choice. 

I had some troubles with the radiobuttons - if you checked one you could'nt uncheck it. But I solved it by adding "checked={weather === ""}. I didn't know from start how to make the radiobuttons required, but learned that I had to ad a name and give each option the same name.
