## The problem

I made a sketch of the app using pen and paper. I used an example project as a guide, adapted its structure to my needs, and customized the questions for my survey. ChatGPT provided React assistance, while a code mentor helped with CSS. If I had more time I would add more questions with a slider and a progress bar to each page.
