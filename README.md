# Survey form with React

This weeks assignment was to create a form using state with React.
## The problem

The first issue I encountered was complete comprehension of what state is. I understood it in theory but not the width of its usage.
Once I understood that, in the process of building the project, it became a bit easier. A basic example is that I wanted to switch between questions, but thaught it would be a huge project so I decided not to do it. Once I saw how easily a team mate had done it it clicked that of course we can use state for that.

Besides that I have respect for the art that is CSS. Sometimes I end up spending way more time on the slightest annoyance in styling than on  the logic of the page. But of course practice makes perfect and I just have to continue practicing.

Radio buttons are hard to style since without ruining its functionality. At least for the first time.
I made them look real nice, but the approach I found and used didn't work with the functionality of the site.
So I had to remove them ðŸ˜­

If I could start over I think I would save a lot of time in just understanding what I'm doing and hence would have had much more time to add features from other levels of the assignment. I would also have liked more time to clean the code up better (which I will do in due time) and add a restart button and fixed the required which didn't work with the normal attribute.
