# Survey form with React

The projects was to create a survey, with at least one radio-input and one select input. The purpose was to practise the purpose of state in React

## The problem

I started out with the basics, making the questions work. Tried to style the page to an ok level. Then I got the idea of the confetti in the end and tweeked my whole page to fit this new purpose. 

Would like to add progressbar and warnings if some question is not filled out (required did not solve this).
