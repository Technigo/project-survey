# Survey form with React

Week 6. This week we was supposed to create a Typeform-like survey to collect data from the users. We practiced React state and controlled forms. The project should consist at least 3 questions. One should use radio button, one a select dropdown and a submit button to show summary of the user's submissions.

## The problem
I made a sketch of the site using pen and paper. I planned the project by watching different code on github. I still struggle a bit with React but im starting to see the perks of it.
