# Survey form with React Brief
The brief was to create a survey with a minimum of 3 questions - a text input, radio buttons, as well as drop-down. We were also supposed to think about cross-browser testing, as well as accessibility.
## Problem solving
I decided to go full-out - I made many questions, and created two surveys in one. A personality test which measures the Big 5, and a values test which measures Schwartz's ten universal motivating human values. I also displayed the results using ChartJS for React along with an explanation, and sent the results to a database using Firebase. I also worked hard on making validation work - that you wouldn't be able to proceed to the next page without filling out the information.
