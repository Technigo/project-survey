# Survey form with React

This weeks project was based around using React to a greater potential by introducing the use of State. The task was to create a Typeform-like survey to collect data from your users.int.

## ❗️ The problem

Due to all of us (students) feeling a bit exhausted from our pace at week 6, I came up with the idea to use this project in a humorous way for a calming and stress reducing experience. 

I wanted to practice different forms of inputs and how to style them differently and connecting them to the React hook useState. I included text input, a range slider, radio buttons and a drop down menu. As an ending I created a css built breathing exercise with a setting and different colors depening on the users answers.

If I had more time I would've tried to make all the styling work for Safari-users(it is best viewed in Chrome as of now).
