# Survey form with React

This survey is for coffee fans in the neighbourhood.
It asks a visitor several questions about their coffee preferences and in the end provides a summary.

## The problem

The project is developed with React + JSX and CSS.
It helped me understand how useState works and how to organize components in a more efficient way.

My plan is to make it more in Typeform style so that each question appears when a visitor answers a previous one.
