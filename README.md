# Survey form with React

This weeks project is to create a form by making a Typeform like product. The project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. 
When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## The problem

The project was fun but a bit tricky because of all the components. I also struggled with the tab index part for a while.
