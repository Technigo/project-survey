# Survey form with React

This is a project I made when doing the Technigo bootcamp (autumn 2020). The project was to learn how to use form fields with React, how to use useState and how to use state to show different components based on where you are in the survey. 

Zodiac Love Match is a 3 question survey where you can find out your zodiac compatible love match. The inspiration for the web design comes from www.typeform.com, and the love match quotes comes from www.yourtango.com.

## The problem

After deploying the news site I tested it with different devtools on several browsers, such as google chrome, safari, microsoft edge and firefox. I also tested the accessability of the site using accessability evaluation tools.
