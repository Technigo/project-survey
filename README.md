# Survey form with React

The assignment was to create a form with react.js and useState. The form was to include radiobuttons, dropdowns and a summary. 

I got the functionality to work quite quick, but it was a challange to understand why it worked and how it was connected. I will continue to try to understand it. 

I stuggeled to make the restart button to work. If I had more time I would like to clear the form when it restarts. I would like to develop the css more.
