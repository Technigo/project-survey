# Survey form with React

This is a survey form done in React to learn about State hooks. I made a health assessment form that reminds of the ones we get to fill out when we first visit the doctor's office. The user will see the questions one at a time and will be redirected to the next question once the next question button is clicked. The survey ends with an overview page of all the user's information plus some description ex. BMI of Healthy weight.

## The problem

### Technologies used
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Open Graph](https://www.opengraph.xyz/) - to check the meta tags on different social media sites
* [@ramonak/react-progress-bar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ramonak/react-progress-bar) - React module for the progress bar
* [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/) - for the images used

### How the problem was solved

This project has smaller components imported in the `form` component. The questions are shown one by one and the overview of all the information would be shown at the end.   

### Future Improvements

My next plan is to able to save the information in a database in order to fetch and manipulate the data. I would also want to do a login authentication for the admin so not anyone can just tamper with the data.
