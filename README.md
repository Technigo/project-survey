# Survey form with React

This small servey is made with React and hooks. I wanted to keep the design simple and instead focus on practising React.

## The problem
I had some problems with css, but managed to fix them through different "walk arounds". I still have some issues with understanding aria-labels and tab-index, so that is what I would want to focus on more. I have mainly used Stack Overflow and google when running in to problems.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
