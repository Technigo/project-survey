# Project 10 - Survey site (Week 10)

### Summary

In this assigment (@ Technigo Boot Camp 2019/2020) I was given the task to create a survey web application. The project consists of questions to be answered by users. When the form is submitted a summary page is shown with answers and questions.

In addition to the basic project requirements I also implemented multi-step form functionality, validation and a progress bar.
