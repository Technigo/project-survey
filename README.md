# Survey form with React

The aim of this project was to practice React state and controlled forms. I made a survey about concert habits and I've added some extra features such as question counter and html (required) validation.

## The problem

I started with the components and made sure I got all information as I wanted. After this, I started with the CSS and moved around html elements. When doing the styling I also ended up adding more component as I realized I could have less code in the App.js. 
Struggled a lot with the buttons. First I had three different buttons but realized I could go with one button component instead. Took some time on google and StackOverflow to get it right. I also struggled a lot with getting the radio button to be required. Got some hints from StackOverflow and tried a million  ways until I got it to work.

If I had more time I would work on a progress bar.

If I would start over I would also put more time on the planning.
