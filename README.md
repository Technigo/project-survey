## Project 7: A survey form built with React

This survey is for coffee fans in the neighbourhood developed with React + JSX and CSS.
It asks a visitor several questions about their coffee preferences and in the end provides a summary.
It helped me understand how useState works and how to organize components in a more efficient way.

## The process

1. Plan on which components to use and how to organize them
3. Create the logic using useState 
4. Style with CSS

## Focus
* React
* useState in React
 
## Challenges to solve

Make it more like Typeform style so that each question slides away when it is answered and a new one comes.
