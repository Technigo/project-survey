# Survey form with React

Second project done with react. Got the assigment to create a small survey in the Technigo bootcamp. 


## The problem

My biggest problem is that I still struggling with JS and now diving in to React. I have a hard time to understand the connections. 

This week has been a little bit better as I have gotten some help and guidience from my code coach. 
I did the first part on my own, but then got some help to connect the compinents to the Form and App files to be able to send data properly. 
Its been a lot of googling, watching the videos from Thechnigo and most of the help I got from my code coach. 

If I had more time I would go through the accessibility part more and try to make it optimized. There is some things that worked earlier (radiobuttons) and after some other changes it stop working and I can find out what the problem is. So I need to put some extra time in to it later to fix it.
Also I would have wanted to experiment with more functions, like range, progressbar and similar.
