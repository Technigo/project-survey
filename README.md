# Survey form with React

This is a project that was made during week 10 of the Technigo Front End Bootcamp. My survey is about vacation/summer since this project was made during spring time and summer was in the horizon.
The task was to build a survey in React with 3 different inputs, and then to show the results in a summary section. This is my second project in React.

## The problem
I started by defining the different components that I needed; 3 inputs, a header, a submit button and a summary. Then I constructed basic inputs and did some design. 

My intial plan was to make the components as re-usable as possible, ie to send all information as props. Although I had to revert this in order to make the summary section. So if I had more time I would go back to this plan. I would also, as always, work more with the styling.
