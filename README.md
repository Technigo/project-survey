# Survey form with React

This was a project I did while attending Technigos 24 week frontend program. The task was to use React to build a survey form. The requirements was that the project should consist of at least 3 questions which need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## The problem

I struggled a bit with understanding the concept of props, but after a few rewatches of the teatchers codealongs I got it to work.
