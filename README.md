# Survey form with React
How to use useState hook with React by creating a Survey of any topic. 
Connect HTML form inputs and form fields. Adding radio-buttons and a dropdown button was required for the survey. 

## The problem
My main problem during this project has been remembering how the steps interract with each other. Missing an import in one file, or using a certain html-div name in another file caused a lot of slowing down my inner rush to actually see what result I get, due to being a results-oriented person. Technigos live session helped me a lot during my process, as well as booked 1:1 meeting with coding coach. My sketch helped me navigate through turtorials as well as Stack for certain codes. I also found former students codes helpful to see clearly if I missed a step. 

I am prooud of this project due to doing it totally solo and with a new approach to how to start a project in general. I found it helpful to break it all down, even though I struggle with the tempo due to liking the coding part of it. If I had all the time in the world I'd probably digg deeper and maybe creating my own dream.js file with different images and items inside to call on in the survey, and really go wild in that aspect of it. Addind if-statements as well.
