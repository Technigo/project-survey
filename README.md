# React Form&ensp;|&ensp;[View Live &#10555;](https://olle-react-form.netlify.com/)

A survey form built with React, using the `useState` hook to keep track on progress â€“ and showing a summary of the survey when completed.

I focused on creating general and reusable components, and used arrays to store the different data inputs.

Styled with the [Neumorphistic](https://uxdesign.cc/neumorphism-in-user-interfaces-b47cef3bf3a6) design trend, using separate css files for each component.
