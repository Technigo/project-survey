# Survey form with React

Here I made a simple survey using react where everything should be summarized in the end after filling in the form.

## The problem

These were the goals I was aiming for to fulfill:

- Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.
- At least one question should use radio buttons.
- At least one question should use a select dropdown.
- There should be a submit button. When pressed your app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.
- Your site should follow accessibility guidelines

I would focus more on styleing and to also break down the CSS into components
