# Survey form with React

I used React to make a survey about where to go on a company retreat. 

## The problem

First I decided on the content of the survey and the different questions and components it would need. I then began building each component, and mounting each one onto the app in the right order. When I had finished the structure of the survey I began styling it and adding accessibility features. The challenges with this project were brought about by design and accessibility issues affecting the structure of my code. If I had more time I would like to add a range slider.
