# Survey form with React

I have here made a little survey about headphones which takes in and validated the data from the user and then displays it as a summary.

## The problem

I was having a bit of problem structuring the site and knowing how to follow through. I did get a lot of help from other students who helped me get a better picture and I was able to deliver the required results. I do say I am more comfortable with React.js than I am with JS at the moment but I feel its small steps to climb a big hill and it will take time to both learn and practice as well as learn to apply the coding properly.
