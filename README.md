# Survey form with React

In this project the goal was to create a survey tool with React using state and controlled forms.

## The problem

I began the project by doing a sketch on Figma. Then I proceeded by building the question structures. I had some challenges with the custom styling of some inputs at first, but managed to find a solution. With more time I would have added validation to the inputs and continued with dividing the code into smaller components.
