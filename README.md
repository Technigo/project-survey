# A RSVP app using React 

For this site I used React to build a survey form, similar to typeform. The completed project consists of 3 questions. When pressing submit, a summary of the user input will be shown.

## What I got to learn ðŸ§ 

* How to use form fields with React
* How to use `useState`
* How to use state to show different components based on where you are in the survey

## Requirements reached ðŸ§ª

* At least 3 questions.
* At least one question should use radio buttons.
* At least one question should use a select dropdown.
* A submit button, which when pressed hides the form and show a summary of the user's submissions.

## Strech goals reached 

* Multi-step form where each question is shown in its own section
* Show a progress bar
