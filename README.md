# Survey form with React

The assignment was to create a controlled form survey built with React using useState() hooks. The user should be able to answer at least 3 questions and when pressing the submit button a summary of the answers should appear. 

## The problem

FYI: I didn't have time to finish the assignment. There are some small fixes to add to the styling and I also have to make the page responsive and go through the accessibility status of the page. 

I approached the problem by building components for the different form elements. I created a function to handle the submit event, using conditional rendering to take the user to the next step of the survey. If I had more time I would explore adding validation to the survey and show different questions depending on the user's answer.
