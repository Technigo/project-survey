This is a project from week 10 of the 6 months TECHNIGO front end Boot Camp. The assignment was to build a survey form using React, React state and controlling forms.

The minimum requirements were that the survey should consist of at least 3 questions, where at least one should be radio buttons and at least one should be a select dropdown. When pressing the submit button of the form, the app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user’s submissions. In addition the site should also follow accessibility guidelines. 

Since I am a big music lover one of my favourite things is to go to gigs, concerts and festivals. It is something I really miss doing nowadays, and I think will appreciate even more once the pandemic is over. So the topic for this little survey became a couple of questions regarding live music habits and Stockholm venues. 

My approach was to keep the App.js file as short as possible, create separate components for the different inputs and mount them in a Form.js file. It was a tricky project since I´m very new to React, although I think I´m going to love it once I get more familiar with concepts and syntax. I really like the building block structure. I thought the hardest part of the brief was to generate the summary, where a result of all the answers from the user was presented.  

Since I have a tendency of getting carried away with styling I made sure that each and every single functionality were up and running to a level of my content before I started doing any CCS code whatsoever. And when I eventually did I decided to make separate .css files for each component for a neater composition.  

When I have more time I would like to make the range slider thumb into an electric guitar icon (something I tried, but didn´t succeed with). I also would like to style the dropdown selections and text field a bit more, make the text bigger and with a nicer font. As I have been making custom radio buttons in the past I decided to live that alone for now and push my boundaries exploring other things in terms of layout. 

I´m really happy I managed to make the background image gallery of live music event and crowds into a fading slide show. It´s not flawless yet - it can get a little glitchy in some displays, so that I something I´ll have to come back and fine tune. 
I would also like to add validation to my form, right now you can submit and get the summary presented without filling it all out – which isn´t really ideal.

I am fully aware my code is kind of lengthy, and when I have more time and deeper understanding I would like to make some more complex solutions (map over the radio buttons etc.) So even though I know it can be reduced, I have chosen to keep it this way for now - making sure I understand it for myself in the first place.
