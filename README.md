# Survey form with React

This week we did a survey-form using React. 

I made a randominzer-survey so when you put in your birth month abd first letter of your name you get your "real" job title. ;) I got inspiration from when it was popular with "first letter of your name game" and digt it as a survey.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I got problems with making the "result page". I googled and asked for help from my team and got help with that. I still got problem with the media queries to get the form section the same size when doing the site smaller/bigger. But will ask our teacher for help with that this week!
