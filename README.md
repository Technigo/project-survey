# Karticakes: Survey form with React

In this assignment, students are required to create a survey using React. The focus when it comes to the functionality was using the useState and connecting between components. Other focus outside of React is accesibility.

## The problem

I started the project by reading the recorded materials. Then attended the live sessions. I goggled a lot. I would say that this project was fun, but I wish I had more time to add in more fun stuff in it. I also need to learn more about accesibility.
