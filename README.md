# Survey form with React

Our second project with React and the main goal with this project was to learn more about React and start using states and do a controlled form (survey).

Project requriments:
- Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.
- At least one question should use radio buttons.
- At least one question should use a select dropdown.
- There should be a submit button. When pressed your app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.
- Your site should follow accessibility guidelines

## The problem

I started out with a plan of the flow. Made a visual design sketch in Figma but also a "component structure" to se how I wanted the user-flow to be and what props to put where etc. It made it easier for me to see how, where and when to connect things in the code later. I really like React, it makes so much sence to split every part up in a component (and also how you work in a design tool such as Figma). Looking forward to learn much more!

As alwasys I get a bit carried away with the CSS but it's because I really like to make things look good and it's really a tough one to make forms look beatiful :) I always try to challenge myself with creating a nice responsiveness to make things flow in as smooth/natural/organic as possible - that's also a really tricky one.

If I have had more time I would have split up the CSS for each component. Might do that when I have the time or for next project.
