# Survey form with React
Really fun project. But tricky, on Monday lecture we got a lot of code handed to us. Got a bit fooled that it was going to be easy. I was hoping to split up the css for each component. Might do that when I have the time. And I always get stuck with the css. I really enjoy that part. 

## The problem
I started out with a plan on the flow. Made a design sketch. I get a bit to carried away with the css instead of focusing on the functions. I really like React. Makes sence to split every part up in a component. Looking forward to learn much more!
