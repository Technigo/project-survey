# Survey form with React

This assignment involved practising using React state and controlled forms by making a survey that gives a summary of the user's answers at the end.

## The problem

I had trouble getting the map function to work when trying to use a conditional inside it, therefore ended up using simple if-statements in my Summary component, for example. 
Would also liked to have printed out all of the questions and the user's answers in the summary but only managed to print out the number of questions they answered yes to. 
If I had more time I would try to fix this as well as improve on the styling (better align text etc.) that took a backseat for this project.
I would also add error handling for when the user doesn't select an answer.
