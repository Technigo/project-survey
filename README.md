# React Survey

Welcome to one of my first React projects. This site let you participate in my not so high quality content survey, but it has some fancy form elements such as select, input, check box and radio buttons.

It changes the state for each question and using the button as validation to make sure no questions are skipped, the last pages gives you a summary of everything you answered. 

# Tech used ðŸ§ 
- React
- Props, useState, onClick
- Button with validation
