# Survey form with React

A simple quiz web application built in React.

## The problem

The challenge was to structure each component to be re-usable, however, it is not achieved in this project because each question requires different input format. This can be improved in the future. Another challenge was including form validation. For example, question about author has alert state to avoid submitting in empty input value.
