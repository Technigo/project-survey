# Survey form with React

The assigment was to make a survey to practice using state in React.

## The problem

The survey had to have at least three questions and the user had to be presented with their answers by the end of it. The material and lectures from Technigo helped a lot this week. It usually does, but this week more than before I think. It was four days of trying to grasp all the new concepts that comes with React (well, not ALL, but props, state and writing JSX). The things I ended up struggling with the most was probably the CSS... I wanted to make some custom styles for select and radio button, but didn't have the time. Also the code for that "select one option to continue" message took a little time to figure out how to write. Over all a very fun project and I learned a lot doing it!
