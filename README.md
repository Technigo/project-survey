# Survey form with React

In this project I used React to build a survey form. When the user have answered all the questions and submitted the form a summary of the answers is displayed. 

## The problem

I started out by creating a component for each question. Later on I changed the React flow since I didn't know how to send the values from my functions back to the App.js file.
