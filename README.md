# Survey form with React

Users should be able to:
1. view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
2. fill in the forms
3. get the summary of the information they have put in

## The problem

I spent a lot of time figuring out how to use one state to update several form inputs.
I chose the starting value for this state to be an object that contains several values from several form inputs.
