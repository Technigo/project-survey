Week 10 at Technigo boot camp 

Build a survey form using React

This week's project was to use React to build a survey form to learn to use form fields with React, `useState`. 
Requirements for the project were: 
* Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.
* At least one question should use radio buttons.
* At least one question should use a select dropdown.
* There should be a submit button, which when pressed should hide the form and show a summary of the user's submissions.

Built with react and css.
If there would have been more time I would have worked more with the assecibility and the responsiveness.
