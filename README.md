# Survey form with React

This project was to build a survey with form elements in React, using state and compnents.

## The problem

I started by making the questions in one file. I used input text, radiobuttons, select options and checkboxes.
Then I split the questions into separate components, which are mounted from the form component. To start with I printed alla questions on one 
page and the showed a summer of the answers when clicking the submit button. After the I changed the survey so that it only showed one question 
at a time. I added a next-button and a back-button, so the user can bothe go forward and back. When all the question are answered a summary is shown.

The way of building this project in small steps helped me understand components and state, how the different components fit together and where the
state is updated. It was good for me to gradually make the survey more advanced and also try out dirrefent ways of doing it.
