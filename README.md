# Survey form with React

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

The assignment this week was to create a survey, using react. The main focus was to learn how to use state hooks.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started out using one input type, creating a compontent and made sure that the state hooks worked. When I hade the logic in place for one component i added more. When I saw that all of the input types worked out I added a windowhandler to make the questions appear one at the time. Later I added validation for each input type.
Lastly I moved all of the question data to its own file.
