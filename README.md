# Survey form with React

A website feedback form built in React. 

## The problem

Started out by building a simple one-page-form and made that one work. Then splitted it out into components and got a chance to practice the mounting part. After that I added styling and animations to make it look nice. 

I planned the project by watching different forms and code on github. 

If I had more time I would make a longer form with if/else statements to render more answers.
