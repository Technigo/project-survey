The project this week was to use React to build a survey form. The completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

The app should also take accessability into account.

## The project

This week I have practiced using form fields with React and how to use the useState hook to store states in i.e a file such as App.js

My goals was to have an app that only shows one question at the time and that on onclick changes the states of the question component. I'm not quite there yet. What I did manage however is to have a form with four questions using four different kinds of input: text, radiobuttons, select and checkboxes.

And when the user clicks the button after answering all four questions the questions are replaced by a summary. In that view I also have refresh button that takes the user back to the first view.

Add validation to your survey! Use either HTML input validation attributes (such as required) o
