# Survey form with React

This week in Technigo bootcamp I've built a survey about how people use planet Earth.  


## The problem

I started with creating an idea and some basic questions and decided on a basic colorscheme for the styling with some movement using animation.
The main topic this week was to continue working with React and to use useState, that's a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. I also continued to learn and use props, components and how to combine everything together.
If I hade more time I would have put more effort in to validation. Also on the styling of radio-buttons. 

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:
The naming convention could be set to the question instead of the function, will change or not do that on future projects.
