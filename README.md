# Survey form with React

Survey form with React
I built an OSA survey. It felt meaningful because my husband turns 40 this winter and then we can use the site on real visitors.
I think it went pretty smoothly this week. I like React, it feels (more or less) logical and structured. I kept it simple, but if I had more time I would expand the choices and ask follow-up questions. I would like to create my own json.
