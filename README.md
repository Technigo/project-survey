# Survey form with React

React-project, doing a survey using state and controlled forms.

## The problem

If I had more time, I would figure out how to validate the forms. I suspect it's because the next-button isn't directly connected to the forms. I also learned the downside to using position: absolute too much in mobile first. It caused a big headache when it was time to make the page responsive.
