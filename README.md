# Survey form with React

The assignment was to build a survey using React. We were to use at least three questions, of which one should use radio-buttons and one should use a select drop-down. The website should be accessible, and the user user should be able to see his/her answers after pressing the "Submit"-button. 

## The problem

This was my second React project, and the first time using state hooks. This was a valuable tool when I built the components, and I got to dig deeper into the concept of props when building the generic component "TextAreaInput". If I had more time, I would check and ensure the accessibility further.
