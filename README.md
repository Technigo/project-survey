# Survey form with React

This week we practiced React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform like product. Our completed project had to consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## The problem

I had issues with React (more specifically how to use state) but got some help from my team and also rewatched the videos from live sessions.
