# Survey form with React

The assignment for this weeks project was to build a app for making survays and store the input from the form to a summary, with React.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I got learn how to style CSS in react which was very tricky in the beginning. 
If I had more time I would add field for e-mail and a button or give suggestions based on the anwers. I also would like to ad a restart-button and "go back"-button un the survey.
