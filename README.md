# Survey form with React üçã

This week was about creating a survey with React.js using states and controlled forms. I did one a survey where the user can sign up for a newsletter. It contains radio buttons as well as a dropdown menu, some input fields and a summary with the confirmation.

## The problem

This week went pretty smooth and I didn't have any larger issues. I started of early with deploying to Netlify just to be able to check the responsiveness and accessability. And make sure I didn't have any errors in the end of the week.

I did also validate the site for accessability with validator w3 with no warnings or errors to show.
