# I built a survey form using React

I used React to build a survey form, similar to typeform. My completed project should consist of at least 3 questions which need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

I could choose what I'd like my survey to be about so it was of course travelling the world exploring new adventures.

(Once a user has submitted the survey I created, it doesn't actually need to be submitted anywhere - the focus here is to practice using React state and controlling forms.)

## What I learned 🧠

* How to use form fields with React
* How to use `useState`
* How to use state to show different components based on where you are in the survey

## How to get started 💪🏼

I forked a repo, cloned it into my projects folder on my computer, opened up VS Code.
In the terminal, I ran `cd code` to change into the code folder
I install the dependencies needed for react by running `npm install`
I ran the react development server by running `npm start`

## Design 🎨

The design on my page was up to me, but I had to take accessibility nto account when I was styling my form elements - so inputs should have labels and should be easily readable and usable.


## Requirements 🧪

* Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.
* At least one question should use radio buttons.
* At least one question should use a select dropdown.
* There should be a submit button, which when pressed should hide the form and show a summary of the user's submissions.
