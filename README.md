# Survey form with React

This week's assignment was building a survey with 5 questions, radiobuttons and select-dropdown. It shows a summary of answers on separate page. UseState hook used to show different components.

This project fill the following requirements:

ðŸ”µ Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)

- Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.
- At least one question should use radio buttons.
- At least one question should use a select dropdown.
- There should be a submit button. When pressed your app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.
- Your site should follow accessibility guidelines

ðŸ”´ Red Level (Intermediary Goals)

- Add validation to your survey! Use either HTML input validation attributes (such as required) or implement custom logic when the user clicks the submit button to make the form fields have validations. If you choose to implement your own validation, you should also make sure to show error messages in a nice way.

âš« Black Level (Advanced Goals)

- Create a multi-step form
- Visualize to the user how far through the survey they are, and how much is left, by creating a progress bar
