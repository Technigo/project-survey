# Survey form with React

The goal of this project was to practice React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform like product. The completed project consists of an introduction page, a user information page and 5 questions. When the user presses submit, they see a summary of their answers.

## The problem

One of the problems that I stumbled upon was assigning string values to the numbers on the slider form. I managed to bypass the problem by creating an objects map in Overview.js and assigning string values to each of the slider numbers. The string values are also displayed in the overview page instead of the numbers.
