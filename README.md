# Survey form with React

Creating survey by practicing useState Hook in React.js

## The problem

Biggest problem is styling in CSS as I find it a bit difficult without a reference 
Had problem with storing the input data to display in the summary page, as I stored useState data in each child component and not in the Form.js, also didn't refer them in each Component im the Form.js page
