# Survey form with React

First project using hooks in React. 

## The problem

I began by making the different components I wanted to make sure everything was working properly. Then I put them all under the App component and used useState to show the different states on the page. If I had more time I would like to try and take apart the App component and put the different sections into components instead and practice using props to send information to the "parent" component.
