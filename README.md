# Survey form with React

The completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## The problem

I tried input type = "time" for the first time in this project. 
If I had more time I would fix the fields that should be required. I have added "required" to them but something is missing since it is not working. I would also spend some more time on the styling.
