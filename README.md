# Survey form with React

This weeks assignment was to create a survey in react. The app/site were supposed to have radio buttons and a dropdown.The survey could be about anything. I did mine about this made up winery, called - Wine, Two, Tree, were the costumer could get email-suggestions on what wine to buy based on the questions.

## The problem

I started this weeks assignment by trying out the example provided and from there I just started to created components and forms were they suited best for the questions.
