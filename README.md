# Survey form with React

This week's focus was to learn and implement the React State Hook on a survey, using forms with validation.

## The problem

I started by creating a basic form, adding a bunch of questions to separate components. My plan was to create a Typeform-look-alike, not realizing that the multi-step form was part of the black level tasks. Blinded by that thought I wasted a full day on research, anxiety and not much coding. 8 hours of sleep later I managed to gather my thoughts and started building a basic form.

Once all questions and answers were connected I noticed the example of the multi-step form in the brief. So instead of putting some thoughts into other, more important todo's, I decided to rebuild my form into a multi-step one. However, this went well, I understood the principles kind of quickly and decided to add next- and previousbuttons, submit button and summary-section.

Before I knew it the structure of the page and styling was done, so then I got started working on validation. Getting stuck here and there, but finally succeeding in adding an alert validation, I moved on to trying to limit the allowed amount of checkboxes. With some help and some hard mental work I finally got the page to work properly. In the middle of everything I also spent a few hours merely trying to save the survey answers into a json-file, but had to give up on it. Can't wait til we get started on Node.js. üòç

If I had more time, I'd give styling the select-input a go, as well as radiobuttons and checkboxes. I would also like to add a range slider.
