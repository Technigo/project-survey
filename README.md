# Survey ðŸŽ¨

https://ucha3i-project-9-survey.netlify.com/

I build a a survey form, using React state. 

The survey consist 3 questions which need to be answered by user. When the user presses submit, he will see a summary of his answers. The questions are on the same page, but the final result on the other one. 

I'd like to continue working on this project and make more then one result option, depending on answers from user.
