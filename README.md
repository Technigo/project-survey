# Survey form with React

This project was done during week 6 of Technigo's Boot Camp. The task was to create a Typeform-like survey, using React state and controlled forms.

## The problem

I created a simple Personal greeting site, where you by answering three questions get a customized greeting at the end. The questions where asked by using input, radio buttons and a select dropdown. The part I struggled the most with was getting the background color to change depending on the given value in the select dropdown question.

If I had more time I would add a counter that shows how many questions you have answered and how many questions is left.
