# Survey form with React

A project where we was supposed to build a survey with dropdown menu, radio button. 
It was tricky at the start, hence the second project with react for me, but the live sessions really walk through it and made more logic and easier to grasp. Also the video for the forms was really help ful.

I still struggle with the responsiveness and looking forward to when it all "clicks" I will continue reading and study and try it out outside the projects
