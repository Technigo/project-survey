# A survey form using React 

Try the survey here: https://mrsucodesproject10thecrossfitsurvey.netlify.com/

For this site I used React to build a survey form, similar to typeform. The completed project consists of at least 3 questions which need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they see a summary of their answers.

I chose to have a CrossFit theme of this survey.

## What I got to learn ðŸ§ 

* How to use form fields with React
* How to use `useState`
* How to use state to show different components based on where you are in the survey

## Design ðŸŽ¨

I used a strong picture and then the inputs had labels and are easily readable and usable.

## Requirements reached ðŸ§ª

* At least 3 questions.
* At least one question should use radio buttons.
* At least one question should use a select dropdown.
* A submit button, which when pressed hides the form and show a summary of the user's submissions.
