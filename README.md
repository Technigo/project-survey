# Survey form with React

This assignment was to create a form survey with a React app.
I created a React app that, through a form, collects simple data about an individual and saves it to an email.

## The problem

I started by realizing what I would like my app to do any why.

I took help from the live session to get the base code going.
I used React with a library of emailjs to generate an email being sent out once the form is complete. This was we are able to save all the data of each newsletter signe.

If I hade more time I would change the checkbox styling and connect my app to a database where I would be able to manage my sign ups even better.
