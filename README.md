# Survey form with React

This weeks assignment is a survey consisting of at least 3 questions. At least one question should use radio buttons. At least one question should use a select dropdown. There should be a submit button. When pressed the app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions. The site should follow accessibility guidelines.

## The problem

I used React. When running into problems I used Stackoverflow and my teammates. This week I also asked chatGTP about some things gone wrong. 
If I had more time I would show different questions depending on the answer to a specific question (if user wants the shrimp named). I would also add a random popup with random facts about shrimp.
