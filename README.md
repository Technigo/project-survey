# Survey form with React

A survey made with React.JS that requests three different inputs and will summarize the users answers 👩‍💻🪐🚀👀

## Code
I've used:
  * **React.js**
  * **JavaScript**
  * **CSS**
  * **Animation**
  * **Accessibility**

## The problem

Made three different questions for the user to answer. First one a text input that requests a name. Next up radio buttons that will chose a planet and last a dropdown where you'll pick your travel companion. Kept the different choices in arrays to map through and therefor limited the amount of code I had to write. 
I struggles in the beginning with the structure and how to make the best use of state and so on. Read a lot of articles and watched some tutorials to really understand how React works - but that time and work I put in really paid off. I feel like I know understand what's going on and why. 

If I had more time I would have liked to figure out how to have one question per page and then have to click on a button to move on to the next. But I put the bar on a reasonable height this week so I'm still very satisfied with how this project turned out.
