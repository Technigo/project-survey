# Survey form with React

This week we practiced React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform like product. Our completed project had to consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## The problem

I had general issues with React and how to use state but was lucky enough to get some help from my team and also videos from live sessions.
