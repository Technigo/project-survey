# Survey form with React

Practicing using form-fields in react by building a survey.


## The problem
Build a survey with at least 3 questions, radiobuttons and select-dropdown required, show a summary of answers on separate page. 
Used the useState hook to show different components.
If I had more time I would have added more/different inputs, made it multipage and shown a progressbar.
