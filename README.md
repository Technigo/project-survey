# Survey form with React

This weeks project was to make a survey with react. I chose to do a imaginary party planning survey.

## The problem

I started with technigos react-starter project and played around in that just to try to understand more about how react works. Then I started to plan what my servey would be about and did the basic structure for it in VSCode.
After that I tried out some different designs and I have changed that a lot of times during the week. I might have to plan the design more before I start next time but I also think I learn a lot by trying out different designs during the process.
I also found the JSConfetti that felt like I fun effect to add and it was much easier to add then I thouht.

My problem this week was that I didn't had so much time as I needed so I need to go back to this project and work on the acceccibility for example. Also, React is completely new to me so it will take time to learn and understand.
