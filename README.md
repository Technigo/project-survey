# Survey form with React

This project focused on using React Hooks and creating forms to build a survey about workplace flexibility.

## The project

The main focus of this project was to practice using React Hooks and connecting HTML form inputs to state. I 
was able to use the state to show different components based on where you are in the survey. The most challenging
part of this project was styling the form elements.
