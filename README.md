# Survey form with React

This week we did a survey-form using React. 

I made a randominzer-survey so when you put in your birth month and first letter of your name you get your "real" job title. ;) I got inspiration from when it was popular with "first letter of your name game" and did it as a survey.

## The problem

I got problems with making the "result page". I googled and asked for help from my team and got help with that. I still got problem with the media queries to get the form section the same size when doing the site smaller/bigger. But will ask our teacher for help with that this week!
