# Survey form with React

This assignment was to create a form survey with a React app.
I created a React app that, through a form, collects simple data about an individual and saves it to an email.

## The problem

I started by realizing what I would like my app to do any why.

I took help from the live session.

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
