# Survey form with React - Character Creator

The goal of this project was to create a form using React, introducing React state. State is used both to capture the user input and to render different components based on that.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

For this project, I used a Trello board to keep track of all minor and major task that needed to be done, which really helped structure my workflow.
I started by creating the components needed for the different inputs, and focused on making them reusable. I created a json file for my data, which also helped making everything reusable. Then I created the buttons for navigation and submitting/going back, and added the functionality to them, which I also connected to the progress bar. Later I added validation.
If I had more time, I would try to find a way to iterate all the stats, so I don't need to mount the range inputs individually.
