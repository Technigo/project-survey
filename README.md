# Survey form with React

This project was our second React-project at the Technigo bootcamp. The assignment: to make a survey in React! I ended up doing a survey to join a fake online platform.

## The problem

The focus of this project was to make a form using different React components and to use the state hook and props. It was a fun project and it was excitng to learn how to use state in React.
