# Survey form with React

Using JS and React I created a typeform project. Using the React state and controlled forms I created a personality quiz. 


## The problem

Using the Technigo repo first I began by creating the Form document and then moved onto the components. Then I created the buttons and created a flow thru the componenets to create a fun quiz that displays all of the choices selected in a paragraph at the end. 
 
If I had more time I would work more with the styling and perhaps give the users options which would change the next selection offered.
