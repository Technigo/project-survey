# Survey form with React

Project making a survey with react states.

## The problem

Did a generic survey trying to add diffrent question approaches practicing react states. Added radio buttons, dropdown menu, slider & a progress bar. Had a hard time figuering out something fun to survey but lack of inspiration kept it generic.
If I had more time I would've wanted to add more questions with more technigues and maybe style it a bit more.
