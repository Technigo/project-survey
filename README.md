# Survey form with React

Small survey made using React. The survey includes text input, radio buttons and drop-downs. The answers are not stored other than being displayed on a summary page.

## The problem

I planned the project before I started to build the site. 
Which caused me not to have much trouble. If I had more time I would build one page to every question.
