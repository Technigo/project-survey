# Survey form with React

The purpose with this assignment was to create a form with React that takes in the users input as props using state. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

The major goal was not working with components for this assignment so I kept it simple with just on additional component - the summary of the application. To create this form I used a few basic concepts of React like components, props, state. I also transformed the props object into an array(using Object.keys and Object.values) in order to map through and print out a suitable HTML element per each prop in the "props array". The reason to this was I started out making a table and reapeting the same pattern for inserting the users input(the props). With the other method I was able to keep the code to about a third of the orginal and therefore coding according to the DRY principle.
