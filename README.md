# Survey form with React

This project was made to test out useState hooks in react. The idea is a helping template to create a passive-aggressive email to whomever you see fit.

## The problem

I started with the content of the page. Sketched out how I wanted every component to look like and then I started to add every form element piece by piece to see how everything worked. After that I split up everything into different components and then added styling.

If I got more time I would continue styling the project. I would also make the "send email" button to work and write my own terms & conditions.
