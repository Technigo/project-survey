# Survey form with React

The assignment was to make a survey using components and the hook useState in React.

## The problem

The survey includes a form with a text input, a select dropdown form and a form with radio buttons. I made image components for every question that each include an embedded GIF. I have made one media query for tablet sized screens and bigger, as I made a simple design I feel it works for bigger screens as well. I chose to style my survey in a global css file as the project is small, had simple styling and I already had image components for every question.
