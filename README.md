# Survey form with React

This week the assignment was to create a survey with React. It was free design and choice of theme but the app should follow accessiblity guidelines. 

## The problem

I started with coming up with a theme for my survey questions. The next step was all components and functionality. The design has been the hardest part because I have a little bit of a hard time choosing the theme for design. I ran my page through https://validator.w3.org/nu/ and got no errors. If I had more time I would have wanted to add a range slider to show where you are in the survey.
