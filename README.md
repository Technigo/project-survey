Week 10 of Technigo's Bootcamp

The assignment was to use React to build a survey form, similar to typeform. The completed project should consist of at least 3 questions which need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## Design ðŸŽ¨

The theme and design of the page was up to me to decide, but I had to take into account accessibility when styling the form elements - so inputs should have labels and should be easily readable and usable.
