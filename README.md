# Survey form with React

The porpose of this project was to build a survey-style page using states in react. I decided to to a travel form. It contains components with questions and different input types. and finally a summary of the answers that the user puts in the end.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

This project went quite smooth, I was able to solve the issues that occured quite easily by following the error messages and adapt the code. If I had more time I would add some more input types and perhaps style the background to change images according to the chosen city that the user puts in.
