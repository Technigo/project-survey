# Technigo Bootcamp Week 10

The assignment was to use React to build a survey site. I'm a gym owner and we have "week challenges" at our gym. So I decided to make a Week Challenge Registration survey. I hope to be able to develop this page later so that it also saves the results so that you can actually use this page. 

If I would have hade more time I would have done a button which allows user to change her/his answers before submmitting.
