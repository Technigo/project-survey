# Survey form with React

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

This is a survey made by me in my 9th week of Technigos bootcamp. 
The assigment was to do a survey that wouild consist of at least 3 questions, One should use radio button another a select dropdown and a submit button that when pressed should hide the form and show a summary of the user's submission. 

## The problem

Since react is so new to me at this point, I found it easier to devide it all in different components so it would be easier for me to overlook the different questions and requirements. 
My biggest challenge was then on how to make them visible in localhost, but once I understood how to mount the components in my app.js, I had no more difficulties. 
I at this point of the education still not confident on how to use props.
