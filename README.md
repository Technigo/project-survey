# Survey form with React

This project was an introduction of the states in React. The goal was to create a survey form and show a summary of the survey answers on submit. 

## The problem

I did a mock and decided what parts of the page would be components. Then I created the components and the states that I wanted to have for the different inputs. If I had more time I would have tried to do a multi-step form and added more images depending on the user input.
