# Survey form with React

This week's project was to create a survey on any matter you choose. I decided on a customer survey and my idea was that you receive an e-mail after order delivery with a link to this page on the website where you can answer these questions-

## The problem

I started out with a plan for all the different components and questions. I didn't decide on the design from the start. It was something that grew naturally when creating the page.

If I had more time, I would have developed the desktop page to look more similar to a web page, with a footer etc. Same for the mobile version, I wanted a hamburger menu and to be able to build on the site. Unfortunately, time was too short.
