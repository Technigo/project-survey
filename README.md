# Survey form with React

Survey created in React during Technigo's Web Development Bootcamp '23. The survey should consist of at least 3 questions, of which one with radio buttons, and one with a select dropdown, and a submit button that would hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions. It should also follow accessibility guidelines. 

## The problem

I started off by coding an example project, before starting on the actual project to get a feel of how I should structure my project. I then started planning the structure and the layout and added one component for the start page, 10 components for the 10 questions of which 3 had dropdown menus, one had radio buttons and 6 had text input fields. I also created a component for the "result" which would generate a "fill in the blanks"-story with help from the data I've collected from the user. If I had more time I would look at validation for the inputs to prevent users to be able to just click their way through the survey without actually adding any input.
