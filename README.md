# Survey form with React

This is a survery project, built by React, prictice forms, "useState". 
## The problem

I create components to each page, some pages doesn't work because used forms in wrong way. If I have more time, I would like to visualize to the user how far through the survey they are, and how much is left, by creating a progress bar.
