# Survey form with React

This project was an assignment where the goal was to create a survey using React.

## Reflections

It was difficult to plan and lay a structure for the different parts of the code. I ended up working on different parts of the survey at the same time, which in the end led to more time being consumed. 

As always, I would have liked some more time for the styling. I am proud of implementing CSS-variables to be able to style the page easier.
