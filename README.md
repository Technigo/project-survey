# Survey form with React

This assignment was to practice Rect state and controlled forms by creating a survey. 

## The problem
I´m really happy about this little project beacuse I planned it well and didn´t add a lot of extra features. I had very little time to work on it, but I were effective during the time I had. 

If I hade more time I would style it some more, validate the forms and maybe add music in the overview.
