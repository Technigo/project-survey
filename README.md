# Survey form with React

This project was about creating a survey form using React. It has a multiple of questions using different form elements and a summary after the questions have been submitted.

## The problem

The most difficult part was to create a multi-step form, showing each question on its own page. This was created by using useState and conditionally rendering the questions one by one in JSX.
