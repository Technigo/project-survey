# Survey form with React

A survey created with react, thd survey starts with a start button. Only one question is shown at at time. The survey end with a summary.The questions are generated from a json file. There is a possibility to generate any number of questions, just edit the json. Only limitation is there is only four question types (radio, text, range, dropdown).

## The problem

The scope was to learn using react useState hook, and create a survey. My idea was to generate as much as possible dynamically since I could focus on the solution instead of the content.
