# Survey form with React

This week we practiced the "state" part of components and state in React. As you can see I worked with lots of components as well but the main focus was so understand state and use state hooks. We practiced this by doing a questionnaire using different kinds of inputs and passing along the information from each question.

## The problem

I started by chosing a theme. For me it's easier to work when I know what I want to do. So I decieded what my survey should be about (reality meets technigo) and then I started with the code. I coded all the different components and parts of the survey I wantet to have. And I made sure I could pass along the information I wanted using state hooks. So I made sure I had the "technical" parts done first. Then I started to style.

One problem I hade was that I didn't know how to pass along a picture as a prop. However a teammate helped me and it was of course much easier than I thought. I noticed that the more components I had the more difficult it became to remember how the props, hooks and all parts should go together. So I was more confused in the end of the project than in the beginning. Had I had more time, I would have gone through each part of my survey and really understand what each part does. It became a lot of copy and past in the end.
