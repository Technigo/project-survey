# Survey form with React

This project focused on using React Hooks and creating forms to build a survey about workplace flexibility.

## The project

The main focus of this project was to practice using React Hooks and connecting HTML form inputs to state. I 
was able to use the state to show different components based on where you are in the survey. This project was
heavily focused on useState, conditional rendering, and form elements. 

I was most proud of the fact that I could refactor my code this week. I was able to remove unnecessary code and 
make my code cleaner by refactoring.
