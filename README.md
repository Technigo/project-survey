# React survey form
[Talk that taco!](https://frijon-react-survey.netlify.com/)

The task was to build a survey form using React with different types of input. The answers should then be summarized when user clicked submit.

## How 

I started with just creating different types of input and connecting them to states using useState. I then fetched the values from the input states and incorporated it in my summary message. After that, I started breaking up the code into separate divs, rendered with conditionals to show one question at the time and in the end the summary. 
Going forward I would like to extend the summary as it now doesn't include the last checkbox, and make the form more accessible for screenreaders, as not all input types are autofocused. I'd also like to work more on the styling, for example with the range slider.
