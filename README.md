This project was made during week 10 at the Technigo bootcamp. The learning objective was to get familiar with state in React.

# Survey form with React

The assignment was to build a short survey with subject free of choice. The main purpose were to practice both useState hook and also connecting HTML form inputs to state. 

## The problem

I started building components for the different form elements. Then I moved on to the trickier part where connecting the form input should result in a summary showing the users answers and at the same time hiding the form. I created a function to set the state of the summary, created in a separate component, to show or not show depending on the action on the submit button. Showing the summary without answers was the next problem so to handle that issue I used conditional rendering in a separate function depending on the input from the user. If I had more time I would continue with error message or some kind of response telling the user that the form needs to be answered before submitting. I would also explore som more form elements adding more questions to the survey.
