# Survey

Small survey made using `React`. The survey includes text input, radio buttons and drop-downs. The answers are not stored other than being displayed on a summary page.

## The problem

The survey was first structured with all questions on one page, using different components for the questions. It was then changed into only showing one question per page before submitting.
