# Survey form with React

This weeks project was to build a survey using components and state hooks in React.

## The problem

I started by creating the form component and then added the different input components one at a time, making sure that they all worked. When I hade them in place I added a page handler to show one question at the time. I tried to keep the components as universal and reusable as possible, only adding and handling data in the form component. I added validation by making the proceed buttons disabled but didn't manage to make the button on the checkbox page disabled. Lastly I styled the page, trying out Sass for the first time.
