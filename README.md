# Survey form with React

The aim of this project was to learn about states, using useState hook in React and how to connect HTML form inputs to state. I made a survey for hotel guests and I've added some extra features such as progress bar, question counter and regex validation. 

## The problem

I think my main problem this week was with the responsiveness and the accessibility, or at least I spent more time on that than I would have liked! Everything looked good in dev tools but when uploading it and looking at it in my actual phone, it was a disaster. So had to spend some time on that and solving it was basically just trying to change sizes until it looked good in the actual phone. Regarding the accessibility I'm still not completely sure if it's as good as it could be, but tried it out a lot with the screen reader and just using the keyboard and at least it works fine!
The radio buttons styling was also time consuming, and there google helped me.
I also spent a little time on the progress bar. Googled some but I couldn't really manage to find something to apply in my project (just one piece) so I tried my way out and finally made it to work. That was a very good feeling and maybe a confirmation that I'm really starting to learn and understand React!

Other than the above it went relatively smooth and I think it was a fun project! If I would have had more time I would have made a question that shows a different question depending on the answer. And change the topic to be something more fun :)
