# Survey form with React

This is a project within the Technigo Frontend Bootcamp. 
The objective was to build a simple survey form, practicing controlled forms, using React useState and dividing the site in different components.

I made a simple sign-up form for a code & hike weekend, with several destinations to choose from.

## The problem

I focused on the basic requirements, including 3 different input types and preventing the form page from resetting on submit. Also to show a summary of the input values that replace the form when submitting. 

I used App.js as the main container, holding the form with each form component mounted inside. I used Form.js for all the input fields in separate components, and Description.js and Summary.js as separate component files. Some of the techniques I've practiced are React useState and props destructuring. 

If I had more time I would research how to add a reset-button after submitting the form, and also showing a different image on the Summary page, depending on the choice of destination.
