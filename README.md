# Survey form with React

This weeks project was to create a survey in react, using controlled forms. There should be min. 3 different form inputs, including a select element and radio buttons. 

## The problem

To start, I made a sketch in figma, which I used as a starting point but later deviated from. I then build the necessary components with everything in them, and once they were done, I added the function to turn the form into a multi-step form.
I found a lot of help in the example project, as well as the intructional video from this week.

To start with I'd written all questions inside h2-elements, but that also meant, that I had no labels. I then changed to h2 to labels. After a wave-test, I realised the labels/inputs where orphaned, and I subsequently fixed that by nesting inputs inside the labels.

One unresolved problem was validation. Tried added "reqiured" to some of the inputs, but it didn't do anything.
