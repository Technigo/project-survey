# Survey form with React

This project is a survey that is built with React. I consists of 3 questions that has to be answerd by the viewer of the site. When the viewer presses the submit button, a summary of the questions will appear.

## The problem

Tech I've used/practiced ðŸ’¥

React / State Hooks

JavaScript

CSS

Started building the form structure in the Form.js. When the form worked as I wanted it to I continued by breaking out certain elements to their own components, for example all the questions. If I had more time I would've added some more questions and practice a lite bit more on the styling.
