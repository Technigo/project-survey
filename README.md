# Survey form with React

This assignment was to create a survey with using state in React.

## The problem

I had a bit chaos this week because first I was too sick to manage to do anything. And when I felt better, the only computer I have that can handle node.js crashed... So I got a new computer on Friday and had that one set up then. Then I made this project during the weekend. Depending on that I had very short time I think this project went very well. I started with making a scetch in Krita, and map out all the components and input I wanted. That really helped to get a clear view of what to do. I had the advantage that a lot of classmates had more or less finished this project when I started, so I could look at their code to see how they approached the problem. I decided to use the same approach as one of my team-mates because I thought it was very clean and logic. I understand every piece of code I put in but now it still feels like I've copied a lot. I'm not sure if I would be able to replicate this project if I had to, but I usually feel like I don't know where to start. I don't know if having all the data in a json-file instead of the in components count as it being reusable either, but I really liked that approached and it felt logical to me. 

There are things I would like to have added and changed if I had more time. I cheated a bit with the responsiveness, because I made a card that looks the same in all screens. It looks nice and kinda as I had in mind though. I would like to have the user choosing between "price" and "weight" with the radio-buttons, and then have a dropdown menu pop up depending of their choice, to chose the unit. I would also like to have the unit show up after the number on the slider. I would also like to have the paragraphs dissapear from the summary of the non-required inputs if the user choose not to enter something. And I tried to add a random image from an array to show up in the summary but I couldn't get it to work. But I think I would have if I had more time.
