# Survey form with React

This weeks project was to build a survey using React. 

## The problem

Last week I didn't understand React at all but this week it felt so much easier and I feel like I understand how and why to work with components. I didn't put that much effort and time in deciding what the survey should be about, therefor the slightly boring topic. I focused on setting up the different components and decided to have a CSS for each component to make it easier to overview. I'm most proud over the animated transition for the welcome-page. As a motion designer I feel it's so fun I've started to understand more how to animate elements and components in code. If I had more time I would have tried to style the drop-downs (didn't get it to work) and put more time on making the subject of the survey slightly more fun.
