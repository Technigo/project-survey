# Survey form with React

A simple quiz web application built by React.

## The problem

The challenge was to structure each component to be re-usable which is not achieved in this project, because each question requires different input formant. This can be improved in the future. Another challenge was including form validation. For example, question about author has alert state to avoid submitting for with empty input value.
