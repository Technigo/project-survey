# Survey form with React

The aim of this project was to use React to build a survey form. For the survey I drew inspiration from an earlier project (https://github.com/elsareutersward/elsas-pizza-bot) and created a survey for booking tables at a restaurant. 


## The problem

To build the project I used global components to which I passed different props for the different questions in the form field. I used 'useState' to show different components based on where the user are in the survey. I also added som validation to the form and that when the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers. Lastly I added som styling to the page to make it more interactive and also made the page responsive.
