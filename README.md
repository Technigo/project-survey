# Survey form with React

Practicing using form-fields in react by building a survey.


## The problem
Build a survey with at least 3 questions, radiobuttons and select-dropdown required, show a summary of answers on separate page. 
Used the useState hook to show different components.
If I had more time I would have added more/different inputs, made it multipage and shown a progressbar.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
