# Survey form with React

A survey made in React, using different types of forms and summarizing the answers in the final step.

## The problem

The major hurdle while constructing this survey was to place everything correctly on the page. If I had more time I would place the buttons better and would also add some sort of counter, so that the respondent can see how many steps they have completed and how many steps are left.
