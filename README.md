# Survey form with React

Week 10's project involved us being introduced to React state. The goal was to build a survey form using React which should consist of at least 3 questions - When pressing submit, the user should see a summary of their answers.

## My process

I wanted to build a survey using components that could be easily modified. I started by building a basic form, focusing on useState and making sure the different states were being updated. Then I decided to make the question components as reusable as possible by sending the question and answers in as props. I also wanted to make my questions appear one at a time as a multi-step form. I did this by creating a question state and a function which updated the state after each question had been answered.
If I had more time to spend on this project I would of added a back button to each question, as well as reset functionality.

I made my site responsive and spent time testing it on different platforms, as well as testing the accessibility using a screen reader. I am please that it scores 100% on Lighthouse for Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO.
