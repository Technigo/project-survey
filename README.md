# Survey form with React

This assignment was about building a typefrom survey by using react components.

## The problem

This project was built with JS, React and CSS using flex and grid for positioning and conditional rendering to only show one question at a time.
I started the project by searching for ideas for the content and then I searched for a design that I could use as a base. 
I took the idea for the content and structure from this type form template: https://www.typeform.com/templates/t/work-from-home-survey-template/ and the design from https://uidesigndaily.com/posts/figma-blog-component-search-tags-links-card-day-1584.

Further to do's: I will add validation to some of the input fields and make all questions required. I will also adjust the progressbar to have a better design.
