# Survey form with React

The projects was to create a survey, with at least one radio-input and one select input. The purpose as to practise the purpose of state in React

## The problem

I started out with the basics, making the questions work. Tried to style the page to an ok level. Then I got the idea of the confetti in the end and tweeked my whole page to fit this new purpose. 

The screen reader doesn't read the page correctly and the tabbing is a bit off, but you can acces all the element you just have to go backwards sometimes... I have to work on that.
