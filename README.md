# Survey form with React

This week I made a survey form using React state as a weekly project for the Technigo frontend bootcamp.    

## The problem

I followed the code-along to build the basic structure. I had scope issues with components, ex. where <Summary /> component doesn't know about the props of another component since the other component is defined in a different file. 

If I had more time, I would have worked more on styling of the summary page. I couldn't figure out how to change the background-color based on the value that comes through the survey form.
