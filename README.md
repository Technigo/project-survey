# Survey form with React

This was project made for Technigo Bootcamp w10. It was made with react and I started using components in a more deliberate way. It's a survey with 3 questions and a summery of the answers at the end.



## The problem

It was a very fun project to make. Not too difficult to make.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
