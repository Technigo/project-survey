# Survey form with React

Thisa is a simple survey built in react using useState hooks. The survey is using form elements and should return a summary of users ansvwers.

Ive started of by scetching up my idea and how i best schould structure the code in React. I realized pretty soon that i needed to get my hands dirty so to speak and actually starting the building of components and structure while still learning to think of the code in the "react" kind of way. I also wanted to keep it as simple as possible understanding every piece of code and how to use the state variables for each purpose. IÂ´ve learned a lot from making this project even though i still need to figure out some things before this MLP-name generator will work as i want i to. Things i will need to fix is:
1. radiobuttons. I made a component for selecting a favourite flower, but i didnt manage to figure out how to retur the input from the component into the results-page. 
2. Fixa so that the "return" button takes you back to the start page. Right now its just a button doing nothing. 
3. Make it more responsive.
