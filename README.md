# Survey form with React

This was a project I did while attending Technigos 24 week frontend program. The task was to use React to build a survey form. The requirements was that the project should consist of at least 3 questions which need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## The problem

I struggled a bit with understanding the concept of props, but after a few rewatches of the teatchers codealongs I got it to work.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
