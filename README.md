# Survey form with React
This weeks project was about react and to make a survey with components.

## The problem

I started from the example project and made my project from that.I had the help from CHatGTP support. And googled questions.
I made a workplace employee survey,
It included:
A name text input/component.
A radio button question component.
A dropdown question input component.
A feedback textarea input component.
A summary with the results.
