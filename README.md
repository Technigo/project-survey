# Survey form with React

The purpose with this assignment was to create a form with React that takes in the users input as props using state. 

## The problem

The major goal was not working with components for this assignment so I kept it simple with just one additional component - the summary of the form input. To create this form I used a few basic concepts of React like components, props, state. I also transformed the props object into an array(using Object.keys and Object.values) in order to map through and print out a suitable HTML element per each prop in the "props array". The reason to this was I started out making a table and reapeting the same pattern for inserting the users input(the props). With the other method I was able to keep the code to about a third of the orginal and therefore coding according to the DRY principle.
