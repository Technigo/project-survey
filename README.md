# Survey form with React

✔️ **Brief**

This week we will be practicing React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform-like product. Your completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. 

**What you need to do**

✓ Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.

✓ At least one question should use radio buttons.

✓ At least one question should use a select dropdown.

✓ There should be a submit button. When pressed your app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.

✓ Your site should follow accessibility guidelines

## The problem

Trying to learn React. Lot of new stuff...

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
