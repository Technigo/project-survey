# Survey form with React

This week I build a survey form with React that should consist of at least 3 questions. One dropdown menu and some radio buttons.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I had a hard time to understad what was the diffrent between a survey and a questioner so I stared out to google that. Then I decided to make the prodject as fun as possible with a non serius topic.

I have had alot of fun this week and I feel that alot of coins has droped about React. I have also started to plan my weeks better and that really as helped alot.

If I had more time on this prodject I would make it in to a serius survey.
