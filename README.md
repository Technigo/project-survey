# Survey form with React

Create a survey with a design of your choosing. It should contain different kind of forms element, store the value with the help of useState hook and be presented as a summary in the end.

## The problem

Started with making a plan of the design and the different questions.
Created componenets for each question and deciding what parameters they should receive.
Got a lot of practice with useState hook. 
For problems I searched on stack overflow, rewatched training material and looked at previous students project
If I had more time, I would work more on the design. I struggled a bit, with styling the components when the same content are re-used. Like the buttons not being optimal for mobile, since the hover effect added for dekstop lingers to next section. I would also like to try and add different things depending on the answer on the questions. As it is now I added one change, if oyu leave the last question empty you will receive a tips instead of providing one.
