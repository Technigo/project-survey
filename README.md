# Survey form with React

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

This weeks project was to create a survey in react

## The problem

I approached the problem as other weeks, "does this work" if Yes GREAT, else (if else statment pun) NO then what went wrong and WHY. I planed my week with learning on monday, tuesday make the base and all the react, thursday css. The tools i used where my AWESOME teammembers, StackOverflow, Daniels lession and my favorite the example given was WONDERFUL! 

If i had more time, i would style it more, and add more things.
