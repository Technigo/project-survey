# Survey form with React

A simple survey in React utilizing state to store and later on present the user input.

## The problem

Multi-step survey where you input your name, chose from a drop-down, and radio button before you are presented with your choices and information about them.

This took a little brain-work to understand properly and how state can get saved and 'passed around' throughout React components to later be utilized.

The nice part about React is how much you can break it apart and work on specific 'tasks' or in this case steps in the form. It makes for a focused work experience, but also requires you to understand where and when things go and should be used. While modularity is nice, it can easily create complexity.

I kept it fairly easy in this project to make sure it was clean and I understood what I did and how it all worked.
