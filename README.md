# Survey form with React

This week's project is to use React to build a survey form. Your completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

I got the id√© of doing a mad lib for this project. 
It looks like a survey and the revelation is a story made up of the user's choice in the form. 
I wanted to try diffrent ways of doing th state. So for the "things" and "thingsTwo" state i did a list with objects to connect the radio button answers and the rest I did it with a "longer" code approche, where I hade to write out every "choice" of the checkbox, intead of just writing the "choices" in the list of objects and then write them out as a group. But in some way I liked it better white the long code but I probebly will not in the future when writeing a lot more code. But now with my new eyes on it it was nice to see everything clearly with the longer code. 

## The problem

I got a problem with the dropdown select and could not figure out
