# Survey form with React - Character Creator

The goal of this project was to create a form using React, introducing React state. State is used both to capture the user input and to render different components based on that.

## The problem

For this project, I used a Trello board to keep track of all minor and major task that needed to be done, which really helped structure my workflow.
I started by creating the components needed for the different inputs, and focused on making them reusable. I created a json file for my data, which also helped making everything reusable. Then I created the buttons for navigation and submitting/going back, and added the functionality to them, which I also connected to the progress bar. Later I added validation.
If I had more time, I would try to find a way to iterate over all the stats, so I don't need to mount each range input individually.
