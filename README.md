# Survey form with React

Survey built with React using React state. Project should consist of at least 3
questions and user should see a summary of their answers after submitting.

## The problem

I started the project by creating the desired components. Since I wanted to make
something simple I decided to stick with only three questions, one text input,
one select options and one with radio buttons. Later on I decided to add an
intro compnent where the user can press a button to start the survey.

If I hade more time I would like to come up with a better survey concept instead
of using the placeholder questions I put in just to get started at the
beginning. I would also like to add a progress bar to improve the user
experience.
