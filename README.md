## 1. What is this?

The purpose of this project was to create a survey, like Typeform, to practice form fields with React, to use useState and how to use state to show different components based on where you are in the survey.


## 2. What did I do?

For this project I used different states to control the different answers and which question to show at a time. 

All the styling was built with vanilla CSS. If I had more time I would focus on make it look nicer.

## 3. Where can you see it in action?
