# Survey form with React

This week we worked individually to create a survey using React. I chose to make mine a Madlibs game.

## The Brief

This week we will be practicing React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform-like product. Your completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

**What you need to do**

✓ Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.

✓ At least one question should use radio buttons.

✓ At least one question should use a select dropdown.

✓ There should be a submit button. When pressed your app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.

✓ Your site should follow accessibility guidelines
