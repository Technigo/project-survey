# Survey form with React

The assignment was to create a survey using radio buttons, input field and a dropdown menu. Once submitted it would show a summary of the answers given. 

## The problem

I watched all of the videos provided and read the assignment brief thoroughly. I watched both code alongs and then proceeded to build my survey. As I went along I revisited the code along videos which helped a lot and I also googled a bit. I loved this assignment and I love React, I finally feel that I understand what I am doing.
