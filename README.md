# Survey form with React

This survey consists of 4 questions/inputs. The inputs come from radio, checkbox, single line and a dropdown. The values is presented in a summary. 

## The problem

The state is handled by useState ( a hook ) in the app.component. I used React developer tools for inspecting the applications  props, the state and hooks.
