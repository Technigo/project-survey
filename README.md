# Survey form with React

In this project I have created a form in JS React by mounting the form elements in components and using state! 

## The problem

In this project I started of with creating the input elements in the form in different components. Working with mounting the code in components from start makes it more logical for me. I created text inputs, radio buttons, a dropdown and finally a range slider - all connected to a form element. The input from the form are connected into a summary that is visible for the user when the last input is submitted. 

Early in the project I added the different components into different sections, showing the questions one by one, and I added buttons making the user able to go forward and back in the form. 

The hardest part for me has been that the required-attributes doesn't work when the form elements are mounted in different components. It does work in Firefox but not in Chrome, Safari or Edge. To make the user answer before being able to click on the 'Next'-button I disabled the buttons until the question was answered - except for the radio buttons. 

The page is styled 'mobile first' and it is made accessible.
