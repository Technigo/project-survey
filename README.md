# Survey form with React

Create a controlled form and use State by making a Typeform-like product while following accessibility guidelines.
The completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users.
At least one question should use radio buttons and at least one question should use a select dropdown.
When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## The problem

I started with deciding on a design for the survey and then set up the basics of the form. After that I created different components and added the functions needed. The hardest part this week was actually coming up with a theme for the survey.
If I had more time I would've added custom style to the form inputs.
