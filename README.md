# Survey form with React

Create a survey using React. When the survey is complete the user should receive a summary of their answers.

## The problem

I began by chosing which components to create and how to mount them in App.js. Next came the difficulties of lifting State and how to do this in a smart way.
If I had more time I would have styled it (the styling now is attrocious) and tried for red and black level goals.
