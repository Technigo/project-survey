# Survey form with React

This project was to create a survey built with React 


## The problem
This was the second project where I worked with react and it's many new things to learn, but it's faster to learn react than a completly new language because JSX is a mix between javascript and HTML. I think it's important to evaluate when to build componants and when to just write code. I think it will get easier to evaluate when you should create componants and when you should not. 

I have created a form for this project including:
- text input
- radio buttons with an array
- checkbox
- dropdown

I have also worked with the accessibility, such as good colors and tab index. 

The site is built of 6 JS files and 5 CSS files. 

If I had more time on this project I would make one question appear at once.
