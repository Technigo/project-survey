# Survey form with React

The assigment was to make a survey to practice using state in React. I decided to make a survey for someone looking for a web developer and by the end it the user is presented with a short presentation of me that differs a little depending on the answers, and links to my portfolio and LinkedIn profile.

## The problem

Since this was our first individual React project it was a lot of new things to get learn. It took me a few days to grasp all the new concepts that comes with React (well, not ALL, but props, state and writing JSX). If I had more time I would probably make some custom styling of the radio buttons and the select/option. I would also have someone proof read everything. Anyhow, a very fun project and I learned a lot doing it!
