# Survey form with React

"This week we're finally gonna use React to its full potential by introducing State. You will create a Typeform-like survey to collect data from your users.

✓ What the purpose of state in React is.
✓ How to use the `useState` hook in React.
✓ How to connect HTML form inputs to state.
✓ How to use form fields with React
✓ How to use state to show different components based on where you are in the survey"

## The problem

This week started out great! On monday i had a really good idea of what i wanted to make, i made a beautiful Figma-sketch and was feeling good!
I worked on my project happely all week until friday morning when i realized i hated everything i had made so far. So i did what anyone whould,
i canceled my weekend plans (as if i had any. lol) made a batch of strong coffee and started from the beginning! I dont love what i ended up with, but at least
its more "me" than what i hade originally planned. I dunno. I might come back here and re-do everything again some time.
