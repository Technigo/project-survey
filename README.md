# Survey form with React

In this weekâ€™s project, we started practicing React state and controlled forms. 

## The problem

The end goal for this project was to create a Typeform like product that contains at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. In addition, when the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

For this project, I focused on getting the blue (or minimal) requirements done, using dummy content only. If I had more time, I would love to also work on the red and black requirements as well as to come up with an idea for a real Typeform product where I could apply the knowledge I acquired this week.
