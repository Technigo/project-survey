# Survey form with React

Mission was to use React to build a survey form with at least 3 questions which need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## The problem

I started to code with the forms parts as Components, but then switched to have it all in App.js. I had a chaotic week with the corona issue but did a few interesting parts like putting the Emojis in a component and styled the dropdown. 
I coded in VS Code.

If I had more time I would like to just work more on this, it's a fun project.

Please note: I've left comments in the code to be able to work more on the project in the future.
