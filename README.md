# Survey form with React

In this project we were assigned to make a survey using React, practicing working with components and states. The survey should have question forms with different kinds of answering input types such as a select menu and radio buttons. In the end of the survey the user should be presented a summary of their answers.

## The problem

After going through this weeks lessons, I started this project by working through the example project for this week, in which you got the opportunity to practice using react's "useState". It gave me a very good starting point on how to make my own survey, it made state clear to understand. I then started planning what kind of survey I wanted to make and what kinds of questions I needed to code. Deciding what kind of survey to make was actually one of the hardest parts of this project, but also really fun. Halfway through I changed my idea a bit, but I'm happy I did. 

Concerning the code I started by writing the free input questions and then went for the more complex ones with select menus and radio buttons. After I had mounted all my components into the app I worked on the styling which was pretty straight forward except for some of the input types, the select menu and radio buttons were harder to "control" with classes than other HTML elements I have worked on before. I have managed to style them partially but not completely, they are still a head scratcher... 

If I had more time I would have liked to make some form of a conditional summary that was presented differently based on what the user answers. I would also have added more questions.
