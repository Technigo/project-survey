# Survey form with React

App created to practice state in React using forms.

## The problem

Quite early in the process I decided to make something more creative and fun than just showing off results from a form in a window. I wanted to create a form that you could send somewhere.
I had a few ideas but eventually landed in the confession room. Initial design idea was a bit more fun and contemporary, I actually don't know how I ended up with this religious expression in the end ðŸ™„

If I had more time I would've add a slider, checkboxes and another design closer to my initial idea.
I also want to change so that when the form has been sent, the page will reload and the user are able to make a new confession.
