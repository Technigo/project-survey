# Survey form with React

A Survey to add a To do - with options like title, descripton, relevance, location and time.

## The problem
For this project we were tasked to build a survey using React and practice using React useState hook. We had free reign to choose what our survey should be about, but we were asked to fill the basic requirements:

The survey should consist of at least 3 questions.
At least one question should consist of radio buttons and the select dropdown.
There should be a submit button, which when pressed should hide the form and reveal a summary of the data inputted by the user.
The site should follow accessibility guidelines.
