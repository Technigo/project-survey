# Survey form with React

This week we will be practicing React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform-like product. Project consist of 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## The problem

This weeks example project was very good help to get the project starting.
I had some problem with the creative freedom after two weeks following a design-file.
