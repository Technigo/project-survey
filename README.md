# Survey form with React

This project is a survey form built with React. It consists of a three-question form to be answered by the user. When the user presses submit, she should see a summary of the answers.

## The problem

I created components for the different input types and used state to check for changes in the input.

I made sure that it was possible to navigate the form with tabs. I used conditional rendering to only render one question at a time.

I started with a small form with only a text field. I created a state to react on input change from the text field. Then I started thinking about what the form would be about.
When I decided on the theme and background image, I expanded the form with one component at a time.

My biggest struggle this week was to getting the submit button for the radio button question to be disabled before a selection was made.

If I had more time I would have done some animated spiders on the last page :)
