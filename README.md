# Survey form with React

This project is about Survey form.

## The problem

In this project I used React, CSS, HTML, JS, npm, BEM. The project is divided in two major components (summary and survey). All survey questions are divided in small components and used in the survey form. I used useState hook and props in this project. I was searching in google and stackoverflow for my problems. If I had more time I would create a progress bar for visualize to the user how far through the survey they are, and how much is left.
