# Build a survey form using React

This week's project is to use React to build a survey form, similar to typeform. Your completed project should consist of at least 3 questions which need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## Design ðŸŽ¨

How you design your page is up to you, but take into account accessibility when you are styling your form elements - so inputs should have labels and should be easily readable and usable.
