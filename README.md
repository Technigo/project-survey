# Survey form with React

In this assignment, I'm starting to use react states by implementing a Survey about food recipes that is connect with an API filtering by the user choices
## The problem

The problem: The filter was not part of the task but was a plus that I wanted to add and was challenging to implement all this logic together and make it works. To make it happen I have created a filter constructor function that concat all the answers selection and making a filter for the API for the moment that is being called 

If would had more time I would add a custom message when the options are required before continue to the next question. Also, I would like to add an error message when the API returns 0 options
