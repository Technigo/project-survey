# Survey form with React

The project was to create a survey using react. My survey contains text input questions, select, checkboxes and radiobuttons - and some fun animations. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
The biggest challenge this week was to divide the survey into sections and still maintain the survey structure. Back and forth I created a survey with simple sections as "section className" and passed they further through an anchor tag, and using the {section === as mentioned in the project brief. I succeed with scrolling function as well as get the survey work with the first way, but anyways wanted to solve it through the second way {section ===. So in the end I choosed to stick with the later option and instead use a 1x1 to learn fundamentally what the capabilities are and how to manage them.

This resulted in that this weeks project didn't get exactly as I wanted in regards to styling and functions, but I learnt a lot about react which was my goal for this week.
