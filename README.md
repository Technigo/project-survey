# Survey form with React

The assignment this week was to create a survey, using react. The main focus was to learn how to use state hooks.

## The problem

I started out using one input type, creating a compontent and made sure that the state hooks worked. When I hade the logic in place for one component i added more. When I saw that all of the input types worked out I added a windowhandler to make the questions appear one at the time. Later I added validation for each input type.
Lastly I moved all of the question data to its own file.
