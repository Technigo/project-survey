This is my interpretation of Technigo's React survey project. We were introduced to the useState hook, and learned what the purpose of state is in React.

## The problem

This was my second time using React in a project, and I found it a LOT easier than the previous week. My idea was to create a survey that matches you with four potential afrobeats playlists based on your answers. I realized as I was coding that my first plan, and the amount of questions I wanted to include in the survey, was very ambitious for me with my current programming skills, so I scaled it down a bit while still keeping my original idea. Instead of having all the questions impact your final result, I decided that one question would ultimately impact what playlist you got. I also wanted a checkbox question where you could select what kind of adjectives suit your taste in music, and I found styling the checkboxes incredibly difficult. This project was very fun though! It might be my favourite idea so far.
