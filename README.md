# Zodiac Love Match ðŸ’˜

This is a project I made when doing the Technigo bootcamp (autumn 2020). The project was to learn how to use form fields with React, how to use useState and how to use state to show different components based on where you are in the survey. 

Zodiac Love Match is a 3 question survey where you can find out your zodiac compatible love match. The inspiration for the web design comes from www.typeform.com and the love match quotes comes from www.yourtango.com.

## The problem ðŸ’¡

- This project is built with JavaScript, using the React framework. It consists of 5 components and an App.js file. 
- The form consists of a input text, select dropdown, radio buttons and a submit button.
- When the submit button is pressed, the forms is hidden and a summary of the results will show. 
- I created a custom data.json file with an array of objects containing the zodiac love match data.
- The app is built with the mobile first approach, with responsive design using media queries for tablet and desktop. The layout is build with CSS Flexbox. 
- The site was tested with devtools on Google Chrome, Safari, MS Edge and Firefox. I also tested the accessability of the site using accessability evaluation tools.
