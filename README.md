# Survey form with React

A simple form with an dropdown, radiobuttons, a input and a checkbox. 

## The problem

A started with a small sketch so I could easily see it in front of me before I started. Then I made all the questions as components. After that I styled it and last but not least I made the summary, and then I styled that one to. 
I don't know if it was the right approach to split up the components first and then put them together. Maybe it would been 'easier' to make the page work and then split them up? I don't know... I'll try that approach next time.
