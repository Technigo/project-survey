# Survey form with React

The assignment was to use React to make a form with a few questions and a summary. 

## The problem

I started with creating a lot of test components to get a better feel for React and useState, and then drawing up a flowchart on paper. When I had built some on that, I decided I wanted the answers to the questions to actually "matter", so I made an array of snacks to compare the answers to. That made the project way bigger and I had to go back and adapt to this array entering the stage so it got a bit out of hand, but I had fun. I will keep fixing errors like components not rendering properly if you don't make a choice (only had time to get a pre-set choice on the first question), and adding a few features, like the summary leading up to a randomized snack suggestion. And more styling.
