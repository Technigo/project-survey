# Survey form with React
The assignment was to create a survey form in React. The survey should consist of at least 3 questions, and when pressing a submit button a summary of the answers should appear.

I did a registration form where the user can get tips of books to read to their e-mail. I put all of the form elements in one component and put the header, button (that is used for submit and also to reload the form from the submit-page), and summary in separate components. For validation of the form i did a function that checks if the inputs are empty, and then shows an alert. If not empty the summary-page is visible and the form-page hides.  

If i had more time I would probably add some other form elements, like a range slider. Maybe also dividing up the questions in separate components and only having one at a time that is visible.
