# Survey form with React

This week's project is to create a Survey form with React. I decided to do a Quiz theme. We are practising React state, controlled forms and use a submit button to see a summary of the answers.

## The problem

I decided quite early which type of questions I wanted. The only thing that complicated the components structure is that we were suppose to have different form elements. But I at least tried to do a generic component for the radio button questions.
I wanted to do a generic component for the select dropdown questions too but I have different html tags (audio and img) for the questions.
So if I had more time I would try to put more Data in my 'data.json' so I could redo the components to be more generic.
