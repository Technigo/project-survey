# Survey form with React

What I learned in this project:

1. What the purpose of state in React was.
2. How to use the useState hook in React.
3. How to use form fields with React.
4. How to connect HTML form inputs to state.
5. How to use state to show different components based on where you are in the survey.

## The problem

In this project I started to write down the structure and design. Next step was to create components and add the functions for the survey.
