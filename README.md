# A survey form made in React

This is a survey form for a boardgaming group's game nights. It consists of 3 questions and when the user submits the answers a summary of the answer's is shown.

## What did I do?

I made a sketch of how I wanted the survey to look and work. I choose colors and images.

I created components for the different input types and used state to check for changes in the input.

I made sure that it was possible to navigate the form with tabs. I used conditional rendering to only render one question at a time.

I initially wanted a multicheckbox option for the game options. If I had more time I would try to implement that. I would also improve on the design as I feel that the spacing and sizes are a bit off.
