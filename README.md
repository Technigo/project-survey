# Survey Project

Build a survey using React in order to practice using State Hook.

## The problem

Had no idea what to do for design/content so just made something up about my favourite dog breed, and then mostly focused on usability. If I would have had more time, adding a back button and displaying different summaries depending on the users answers would have been at the top of my list.

### Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- React

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code formatting
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment
