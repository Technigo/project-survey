# Survey form with React

The project was to make a survey implementing useStae in Reactjs. 
The requirements were to use different types of form inputs, displaying a summary at the end. 
I created a property search website, taking in requirements from the user and displaying results based on it. A sample API result was used from https://www.booli.se/ and modified for use in this project. 

## The problem

I created components based on question type so that each question type is reusable if needed without having hard coded values. 
The tutorials provided were of great help, but I also used Google extensively and collaborated with team members to solve problems. 
For the progress bar, I have used React Bootstrap. 
I also learnt about storing all useStates in an object according to this documentation https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useState#updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state
