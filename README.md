# A survey form by using React
In this project I have made a survey about everyday activities that may emit Carbon-dioxid. 



## Methods 🧠

* This project uses React, absed on Technigo boilerplate.
* The Survey is based on Form fields with React
* The use of `useState` to get updates to the webpage.
* The state to show different components based on if the submit button is pressed or not.

The projet also includes another survey about Christmas (in App1.js), that easy can be activated instead of the co2-survey.
