# Survey form with React

This week I have used React to its full potential by introducing State. I have created a Typeform-like survey to collect data from my users.

## What I have learn

✓ What the purpose of state in React is.

✓ How to use the `useState` hook in React.

✓ How to connect HTML form inputs to state.

✓ How to use form fields with React

✓ How to use state to show different components based on where you are in the survey

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
