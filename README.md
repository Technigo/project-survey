# Survey form with React
Creating a survey in React. Using React state hooks + components and props for structure.
Conditional rendering based on if the form is submitted or not.

## The problem
Besides from useState hooks, this project is based on html form and required tags for validation. Approached based on conditional rendering: if form is not submitted (i.e. usestate acts as a flag with boolean value), then render this (the form), else render this (the form response).
Next steps would be to make the components reusable for many different questions, e.g. in the input field component.
