# Survey form with React

This weeks project was centered around finally using React to its full potential by introducing State. The task was to create a Typeform-like survey to collect data from your users.

## The problem

For this weeks task, I quickly came up with the idea to create a site where the user answers questions about tv-preferences, and in the end it generates a random suggestion from an array based on data that has been filtered by the users answers. It turned out to also be great practice on arrays and ternary conditionals!

I wanted to practice different forms of input, connecting it to the React Hook useState, and decided to include a text input, radio buttons, a drop down menu, a range slider and a checkbox. If I had time, I would include even more. One thing I was trying to create, but decided to skip since I thought it would take more time than I had left, was being able to select multiple genre options to filter on.
