# Week 10: Survey form with React

This week's assignment was to make a Typeform like survey app practicing React state and controlled forms.

## The problem

The survey should consist of at least three questions where at least one should include radio buttons and one should include a select dropdown. When the submit button is pressed the input form should be hidden and a summary displayed instead. The survey app should also follow accessibility guidelines.

First a created separate css files for all the components but I thought it got a little bit messy this way and added most of the styling of the components in the index.css file instead.

I used two switch statements inside the Form component in order to show different components depending on the displayPage state.

If I had more time I would add some input validation and maybe some more input types and a progress bar.
