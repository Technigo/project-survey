# Survey form with React
This week's project was to use React to build a survey form. The completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## The problem
I had a lot of problem getting the radio buttons to work, and in the end I still couldn't make them work correctly. 
Also I choose not to style the page in anyway because I was running out of time.
