# Survey form with React

This is a survey project to learn how to make a form with React using state. 

## The problem

I started by setting up the form with React and JSX for the different questions. I also made states for each question. 
When submitting the form a summary shows with your answers.
If I had more time I would have liked to make more components and a return button to be able to start the survey again.
